This directory is the output of **Stage 4** (sub-prompt
[`../sub-prompts/prompt-4-final-narrative.md`](../sub-prompts/prompt-4-final-narrative.md)).
The final-narrative carries the full-narrative to publication quality by
implementing the corrections identified from the full stage. It is the
submission-ready manuscript and compiles in Overleaf as committed.

## Corrections applied from the full-narrative

| Correction | What was done |
|:--|:--|
| Vertical white bands | `\raggedbottom` replaces `\flushbottom` so the page bottom is natural, not stretched |
| Stranded tables | `\needspace` before every table |
| Pillar to provision | A synthesis table maps all eight pillars to the exact provision of H. R. 9510 |
| Figure routing | Cleaner feedback-arrow routing and a width safety margin on the widest figure |
| Symbols and dashes | Verified "§" (never "SS") and single hyphens only |
| Even spacing | `\sloppy`, `\emergencystretch`, `microtype`, maximal widow and club penalties |
