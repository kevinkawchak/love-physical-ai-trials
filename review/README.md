This directory holds the entire narrative review that supports the transition of
Physical AI Trial Bill **H. R. 9510 v5.0** into a new Federal AI law. The review
is a single, growing manuscript written for legislators in medical AI who have
neither robotics experience nor Claude Code and Codex application experience. It
gains technical substance as it proceeds, defining each term where needed, and it
makes its case through eight emotional pillars, each pairing a felt appeal with a
credible, cited fact.

## How the build works

A single submitted prompt (`prompts/prompt-narrative.md`) drives two processes:

- **Process A** generated the four unique sub-prompts in `sub-prompts/`.
- **Process B** runs those sub-prompts in sequence to grow the manuscript through
  four stages: the 20+ colored Mermaid figures (`mermaid/`), then
  `draft-narrative/` (scaffold with bracketed instructions naming exact source
  files), then `full-narrative/` (rendered prose), then `final-narrative/`
  (publication quality).

## The eight body sections (SECTION GOALS)

| # | Section | Emotional pillar | Guiding appeal |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | Compassion and empathy | care for the patient | "What happens if we do nothing?" |
| 2 | Fear of preventable harm | avoidance of loss | "Without this law, more people will suffer." |
| 3 | Moral outrage | fairness | "This should not happen in America." |
| 4 | Hope | opportunity | "We can save lives if we act." |
| 5 | Responsibility and duty | obligation | "You have the power to prevent this." |
| 6 | Protection of vulnerable people | protection | bias, consent, and subgroup safety |
| 7 | Trust and reassurance | confidence | "This technology can be trusted." |
| 8 | Urgency | timeliness | "Patients are waiting now." |

## Visual media and palette

No raster images are used. The permitted media are full-width white-background
tables, monospace ASCII figures, and colored Mermaid diagrams (native in
Markdown, reproduced as colored TikZ in the compiled LaTeX). The strict palette
is black, grayscales, and `#EBCB8B` (gold, hope), `#D08770` (clay, risk), and
`#8B2E3F` (burgundy, the Act). The `#8B2E3F` paper template theme is preserved.
